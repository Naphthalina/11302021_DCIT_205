            <p class="p1"> Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we are living in. Therefore, if society is to make rapid economic advancements and fully benefit from information technology, computer science education is essential. The study and creation of applications that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function dependably, accurately, and morally are all included in computer science. Employers who hire computer scientists expect competent programmers with knowledge of modern techniques and tools as well as the ability to apply sound engineering principles to the development, construction, and maintenance of their products. Computer programming is at the core of computer science.</p> 
        
            <p class="p2"> Our graduates are prepared for the computing industry by the variety of courses offered in the department and the skills they acquire. These courses enable students to work in a project team, research and development team, or other setting where they can contribute specialized skills. Additionally, by exposing students to current computer science research topics and both established and emerging technologies and methodologies, the course offers a platform for additional study or research.</p>
            
            <p class="p3"> The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>

                <p class="our-goals-text">
                    To systematically study and comprehend computation, algorithms, and information processing is the aim of computer science. 
                    It entails the creation of theories, procedures, and technological tools for creative problem-solving, data manipulation, and application. 
                    Software development, artificial intelligence, data analysis, algorithms, and the design and analysis of computer systems are just a few of the many topics that fall under the umbrella of computer science. 
                    The ultimate goal is to use computational techniques and technologies to improve human capabilities, automate tasks, and solve complex problems.
