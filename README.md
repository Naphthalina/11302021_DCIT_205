     **A clone of the University of Ghana Computer Science Department Website**

This project is about establishing a dedicated online hub to connect the computer science community and promote collaboration, communication, and information sharing between researchers, instructors, and students.

The purpose of this website is to assign a single point of access to crucial departmental announcements, information, and resources. By providing discussion boards, project collaboration spaces, and networking opportunities, you can encourage collaboration between students, faculty, and researchers. Provide a library of scholarly materials to assist students in their learning and research, such as research papers, lecture notes, and coding examples. Provide RSVP capabilities, an events calendar, and post-event documentation to streamline event planning and participation.


This website contains;

-An accademic webpage: It serves as a digital gateway to an educational institution, providing a centralized online space for the dissemination of crucial information, resources, and communication within the academic community
