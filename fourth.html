    <div class="facilities">OUR FACILITIES</div>
    <p class="facilities-text">Several necessary facilities serve the various needs of students, researchers, and educators in a computer science department.
         These facilities include classrooms and lecture halls with state-of-the-art teaching aids, a well-stocked library with digital resources, networking/server rooms that offer hands-on experience in managing servers and networks, computer labs with the necessary software and high-speed internet, and specialized research labs that foster in-depth exploration in areas like cybersecurity and artificial intelligence.
          Together, these resources provide a thorough environment that fosters cutting-edge computer science research, practical application, and theoretical learning.

    <p class="computer-lab">Computer Labs</p>
    <p class="computer-lab-text">Computer labs are essential parts of a computer science department because they help students develop their skills and learn theoretical concepts through hands-on activities.
        Students can access computing resources in computer labs that may be beyond the capabilities of their own devices. Students can work on a range of projects and gain practical experience by having access to specialized hardware and software related to computer science courses.
        The best places for students to practice coding and programming are labs. They can work on coding tasks and projects and experiment with various languages.
         Students can work with peers, debug their code, and get quick feedback from teachers.
         Labs also give students majoring in networking or system administration the chance to work with networking hardware, set up servers, and troubleshoot problems.
         Lab exercises that are practical improve knowledge of server management, security protocols, and network protocols.
         High-speed internet access is usually availables, enabling students to research, study, and stay current on industry advancements.

    <p class="classroom">Classrooms and Lecture Halls</p>
    <p class="classroom-text">
        A computer science department's lecture halls and classrooms are vital to students' academic experiences and education. 
        Classrooms offer a controlled environment where teachers can present lessons, lead discussions, and involve students in different educational activities.
         Lecture halls provide an environment that is conducive to understanding complex computer science concepts and allow for focused learning by reducing distractions. 
         These areas support conversations and group activities, enabling students to work together on projects, find solutions to issues, and exchange ideas.
         Teachers can set up group projects in the classroom to promote cooperation and the real-world application of computer science concepts.
          In addition to creating a conducive learning atmosphere, comfortable seating arrangements in lecture halls and classrooms help students concentrate on the material being covered.
           In a computer science department, lecture halls and classrooms provide the basic framework for organized instruction, integrating technology, fostering teamwork, practical exercises, and evaluations.

    <p class="library">Libraries</p>
    <p class="library-text">
        Libraries hold a vast array of computer science-related books, journals, conference proceedings, and research papers. 
        This collection offers researchers and students a wide range of viewpoints and in-depth information on a number of field-related topics. 
        Librarians help teachers and students make sense of the often confusing world of information. 
        They support access to specialized databases, research strategies, and literature reviews.
         Additionally, librarians are essential in keeping users informed about the most recent advancements in computer science.
          Libraries offer spaces for group collaboration, meeting rooms, and quiet study areas. 
          These settings encourage concentrated work and group discussions, which helps both solitary study and cooperative research projects. 
          In conclusion, computer science department libraries act as knowledge centers by offering a variety of materials and services to assist instruction, learning,
