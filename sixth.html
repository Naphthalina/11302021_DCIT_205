                Regina, who describes herself as a "coder who loves a challenge," didn't even know any female IT role models when she was a child. 
                She enjoys working with girls now and educating them about the opportunities in math, science, and technology.
                We appreciate Regina sharing more of her story, her secrets to success, and her future journey with women who want to work in technology or entrepreneurship.
                Her passion is using technology to spark social change, and she does this through her company, Soronko Solutions. She is currently working on a location-based mobile application for Accra, Ghanaian SMEs, to help them become more visible and competitive with larger companies.
